# MPICompiler
This project integrates OpenMPI into a compiler to enable distributed and parallelized compilation across multiple machines, improving speed and efficiency. It modifies the parser and compiler codebase to generate parent and child C files, with the parent delegating tasks and the child workers executing functions in parallel.
